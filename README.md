# FairMAMABAlgorithms
a library implementing fair algorithms for multi-agent multi-armed bandit problems. Fairness is measured in terms of the Nash Social Welfare.

This code accompanies a project regarding the paper "Fair Algorithms for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits" [Hossain et al., 2021].
It includes implementations of all algorithms proposed in the paper, plus novel extensions for Thompson Sampling and UCB-V.
