# FairMAMABAlgorithms
a library implementing "fair" multi-agent multi-armed algorithms. Fairness is measured in terms of the Nash Social Welfare.

Includes implementations of algorithms proposed in "Fair Algorithms for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits" [Mohammad et al., 2021], and some novel extensions for Thompson Sampling and UCB-V.
